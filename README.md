# all-pay-auction
All_Pay_Auction implements an all-pay auction where every bidder pays their bid, regardless of winning. The highest bidder wins, but all participants pay their bids. The seller sets a closing date for the auction, after which no bids are accepted. At settlement, the auctioneer collects payments from all bidders.
