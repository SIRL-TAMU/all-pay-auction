## Communication channels
Communication is key. Response to teammates in a timely manner and be sure to give notice if you're unable to attend meetings.
Main communication channel is Discord server.  

## Meetings

### Stand-up meeting
15-minutes stand-up meeting will be held online through Discord. 
The meeting will be held 3 times/week (subject to change anytime). 

The tentative meeting schedule is as follows:
| Day          | Time        |
| -----------  | ----------- |
| Tuesday      |  10 AM      |
| Thursday     |  10 AM      |
| Friday       |  7 PM       |


#### Meeting rules
- All team members are expected to attend the meeting to update their progress or discuss issues.
- In case of an emergency that prevents a person from attending the meeting (e.g., sickness, attending a conference, job interview, etc.), they should notify the product owner and scrum master ahead of time by pinging @. The product owner and scrum master will decide on a course of action on a case-by-case basis, such as scheduling an individual meeting at a different time.


### Client meeting
Product owner will communicate with client to decide on the meeting date/time for each sprint.


## Ground Rules
- If you encounter a problem, don't hesitate to ask for help.
- Everyone is expected to treat each other with respect. The team will not tolerate any form of harassment and will notify the professor if it occurs.
- Regularly check Discord for updates!
- Attend all meetings.
- In case of an emergency (e.g., sickness, attending a conference, job interview, etc.), notify (ping @) the product owner and scrum master as soon as possible.
- Have fun! :)
